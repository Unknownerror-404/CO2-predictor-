    <h1>⚖️ Old Gas Balance of the Earth</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Before industrialization and human interference, Earth’s atmosphere maintained a delicate gas balance that supported life for millions of years. The ratios of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor were stable, and this equilibrium kept the planet livable and diverse.
    </p>

    <h2>🌏 Ideal Pre-Industrial Composition</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🌬️ Oxygen (O₂): ~21%</li>
      <li>🌫️ Carbon Dioxide (CO₂): ~280 ppm (now over 420 ppm)</li>
      <li>💨 Nitrogen (N₂): ~78%</li>
      <li>💧 Water Vapor: variable but naturally regulated</li>
      <li>🌿 Trace Gases: Argon, Methane, Neon, etc. were minimal</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌱 How the Balance Was Maintained</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Photosynthesis absorbed CO₂ and released O₂</li>
      <li>Forests and oceans acted as massive carbon sinks</li>
      <li>Volcanic activity slowly contributed to the atmosphere over millennia</li>
      <li>Minimal disruption from species meant cycles stayed uninterrupted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📉 What Went Wrong?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Industrial Revolution triggered mass-scale fossil fuel usage</li>
      <li>Widespread deforestation reduced natural oxygen production</li>
      <li>Greenhouse gases accumulated faster than Earth could absorb them</li>
      <li>CO₂, CH₄ (methane), and N₂O levels disrupted global climate balance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Let’s be clear — we are not against industrialization. It has brought countless benefits to humanity: medicine, technology, connectivity, and comfort. But it’s the <strong>excessive, unchecked industrial activity</strong> that has led us here — consuming resources faster than nature can replenish.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we once had was a planetary gift — a balance that made Earth unique in the solar system. Disturbing this balance not only affects temperature, but food, water, wildlife, and health. The good news? Nature still wants to recover — but only if we let it. Sustainable innovation, clean energy, and respect for Earth's limits are the way forward.
