    <h1>üìò About This Project</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      This project was born from a passion for the planet and the belief that knowledge can lead to action.
      Rushi Dushinge, with a strong interest in <strong>environmental science</strong> and <strong>geography</strong>, began thinking deeply about the Earth's changing atmosphere during his 12th-grade journey in the PCM stream.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was in those formative days that his <strong>Chemistry teacher, Late Ramakant Sir</strong> ‚Äî a brilliant and dedicated educator ‚Äî would often explain the nature of gases and chemical substances with deep insight and concern. His words stayed with Rushi, planting the seed of awareness and responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the encouragement and collaboration of his close friend <strong>Aniket Kuyate</strong>, the idea for a structured environmental awareness project took form. Together, they drafted the blueprint for what would become the CO‚ÇÇ Awareness Portal ‚Äî a platform not meant for personal benefit, but to inform, educate, and inspire change in even one person.
    </p>

    <h2>üå± Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This initiative is driven by one purpose: to <strong>highlight the invisible threats of unnecessary and hazardous gas emissions</strong> and encourage everyday citizens to take action. It's not about fame, profit, or recognition ‚Äî it's about responsibility and hope.
    </p>

    <h2>üîß Challenges Faced</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Accessing clean and trustworthy datasets</li>
      <li>Designing an interface that is both simple and educational</li>
      <li>Balancing school academics while researching environmental data</li>
      <li>Learning new technologies to build an interactive platform</li>
      <li>Overcoming emotional setbacks, especially after the passing of Ramakant Sir</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåç Support from the World</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the obstacles, the creators were motivated by the incredible support of peers, mentors, and the global climate science community. Inspiration came not just from textbooks, but from the Earth itself ‚Äî witnessing rising temperatures, unseasonal storms, and visible smog made the mission urgent and real.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CO‚ÇÇ Awareness Portal stands as a humble tribute ‚Äî to nature, to education, and to the late Ramakant Sir, who helped light the spark of curiosity and purpose.
